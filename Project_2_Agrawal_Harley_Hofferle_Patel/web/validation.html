			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>The validation tests are used to verify that the ‘Delivery Drone’ system satisfies the design requirements.  The validation test cases (VTC) and detailed descriptions of each are described below:</p>
				<p>VTC-1: The system powers on successfully.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully power on from a powered-off state.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-2: The system powers down successfully.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully power off from a powered-on state.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-3: The system successfully receives and stores delivery instructions from a central monitoring system.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies whether delivery instructions can be successfully received from a central monitoring system and stored in on-board memory. The “delivery instructions” consist of waypoint instructions, landing instructions, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-4: The system does not receive and store delivery instructions if the system is currently off.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that delivery instructions are not received and stored in memory if the system is currently in the powered-off state.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-5: The system stores received waypoint instructions in the proper order in memory.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that waypoint instructions are stored in the proper order in on-board memory. The waypoints are destinations that the drone should travel to on the way to its delivery destination.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-6: The system successfully turns on the drone's engine/rotors and takes flight.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully power on the drone’s engines and rotors. The drone should take flight after powering on these components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-7: The system successfully turns off the drone's engine/rotors and lands.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully power off the drone’s engines and rotors. The drone should land after powering off these components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-8: The system accurately determines the drone's location, altitude, and speed.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can determine the location, altitude, and speed of the drone as it is traveling in the air.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-9: The system accurately compares the drone's location, altitude, and speed to waypoint instructions.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can accurately compare the drone’s current location, altitude, and speed to a waypoint’s location information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-10: The system accurately controls the drone's location, altitude, and speed.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can make the necessary adjustments to the drone’s components to control the location, altitude, and speed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-11: The system accurately accesses the waypoint information in proper order (while traveling to the destination).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system accesses the waypoints in the proper order from memory. This information should be accessed as the drone travels to its destination.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-12: The system accurately accesses the waypoint information in reverse order (after reaching the destination).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system accesses the waypoints in reverse order from memory. This information should be accessed after the drone has reached its destination.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-13: The system accurately determines that it has reached the destination.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system accurately determines that the drone has reached its destination.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-14: The system determines whether a successful landing has occurred.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can determine whether the drone has landed successfully.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-15: The system accurately detects that an emergency has occurred.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system accurately detects that an emergency has occurred. An emergency can consist of a system failure, severe weather conditions, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-16: The system instructs the carrying mechanism to release upon landing.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system instructs the carrying mechanism to release only when a successful landing has occurred. The drone’s carrying mechanism is used to carry a package to a destination.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-17: The system does not release the carrying mechanism if a landing has not occurred.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the carrying mechanism is only released upon a successful landing, and not prematurely.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-18: The system successfully transmits system events to a central monitoring system.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully transmit all system events to a central monitoring system. System events consist of landing information, deviations from the travel path, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>VTC-19: The system successfully stores and accesses diagnostic information in on-board memory.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This test case verifies that the system can successfully store system diagnostic information in on-board memory.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Traceability Matrix</h4>
				<p>The validation test cases are organized around a traceability matrix.  For each test case, an “X” is provided to indicate the <a href="https://gabrieltipton.github.io/CS5744_Project1/requirements.html">functional requirements</a> for the system that will be tested and verified.  The traceability matrix can be seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong> below:</p>
