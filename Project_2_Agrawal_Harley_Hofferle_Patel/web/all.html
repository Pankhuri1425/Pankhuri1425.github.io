				  <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Test Scope</h1>
				  <p class="lead my-3">The delivery drone system incorporates software and hardware components to achieve the objectives of an autonomous delivery system. The scope of this testing will be limited to high-level integration and validation testing of the entire system. The use cases stated in the system design will be used as the basis for the scenarios to be tested.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<h4>Test scenario 1:</h4>
				<p>This series of tests will validate that the drone system can accept an address, plot the delivery route, navigate the drone to the address, land and release the package, then return to the warehouse.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 1:</strong> Valid drone ID, valid address within drone range and package within weight limits. This tests successful completion with ideal conditions.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 2:</strong> Invalid drone ID. This tests that the system correctly handles a typo in the drone ID, a drone is down for maintenance, or other scenarios where the selected drone is unavailable.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 3:</strong> Invalid address. This tests that the system correctly handles an invalid address instead of attempting to navigate to an unknown location.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 4:</strong> Valid address out of range. This validates that the system can correctly calculate whether the delivery address is within the range of the drone. This test case also validates if the system can handle situations where drones do not have the range to successfully deliver.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 5:</strong> Package over weight limit. This test case tests the ability of the system to detect a package that has an actual weight above the limitations of the drone. The system should be able to detect this and abort the delivery versus attempting to deliver an overweight package.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<h4>Test scenario 2:</h4>
				<p>This scenario tests the ability of the drone system to react to weather events and adapt. This scenario will need to be conducted in a controlled environment, such as a wind tunnel to consistently simulate weather events.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 1:</strong> Blown off course within reroute parameters. This will test the ability of the system to dynamically re-route the drone after being blown off course to an extent where the delivery is still within range of the drone.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 2:</strong> Blown off course outside reroute parameters. This will test the ability of the system to handle a situation where the drone is blown so far-off course that the delivery can no longer be made.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 3:</strong> Unable to communicate with central monitoring station. This will validate the system can correctly handle a situation where the drone is blown off course and is unable to receive a new route from the central monitoring station due to communication problems.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<h4>Test scenario 3:</h4>
				<p>This scenario tests the ability of the drone system to react to low battery situations, either due to the drone battery not being fully charged prior to executing a delivery, or battery failure during a delivery.</p>
				<p><strong>Test case 1:</strong> Battery failure during delivery. Using a timed or remote-controlled function, the battery of the drone will simulate a drop below the minimum defined threshold to observe if the situation is correctly handled by performing a controlled landing and broadcasting location information.</p>
			</div>

		<!-- Integration Builds -->
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Integration Builds</h2>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>The delivery drone system mainly consists of four modules: the <strong>feedback control system</strong> - the flight controls for air speed, altitude and direction; the <strong>sensors</strong> and other supporting components – for sensing the current state of the drone through its GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, the internal memory, and transmitters; <strong>the control module</strong> – controls for the drone’s landing, take-off, directional control etc.; <strong>the drone object</strong> – which represents the physical components of the drone that enable the flying, carrying and delivering of packages. The integration testing will be performed on these modules.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p><strong>The sensor and other supporting components phase:</strong></p>
				<p>The sensors used in the drone system should all work in perfect harmony and consistently. The accelerometer should be able to calculate the acceleration force acting on a drone correctly.  The component is used to determine the drone’s position in space and in monitoring its movement. Obtaining a correct accelerometer reading will also ensure a correct GPS reading.  The GPS is used to collect the next waypoint information and to determine when the drone arrives at the destination.  Upon reaching the destination, pre-landing instructions will be used to instruct the package carrier to release the package.</p>
				<p>Barometers are sensors that measure air pressure. In drones, this air pressure information is used to determine the drone's altitude.  This information is useful while delivering, as the roofs of various destinations can be of varying altitude.  Knowing the correct location through GPS will help in correctly determining the altitude. The gyroscope measures the rate of rotation and helps to keep the drone balanced.  Maintaining the drone’s balance is an integral part of the whole drone delivery system.</p>
				<p>Along with this, various other supporting components can be tested. This could include testing the system’s ability to monitor the battery level. Another could include testing the transmitter/receiver to ensure that it correctly and securely exchanges data from the central system and stores it in the internal storage.</p>
				<p>Doing integration testing for all the sensors simultaneously would be a good idea, as most of the sensors are dependent on each other.  Doing so will ensure correct information exchange, which is important in various other phases.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p><strong>The drone module phase:</strong></p>
				<p>This module consists of drone physical components like the engine, rotors, package carrying component etc. These components are responsible for navigating and carrying/delivering the package. All the of the components must receive information and react to it in real time. Any lag in receiving information or lag in reaction can lead to collisions with other drones, buildings or other objects in its path.  Other concerns include an increase in delivery time or even damage to the package.</p>
				<p>Doing integration testing for these modules will ensure that the drone can perform a successful delivery.  The testing will also ensure that the drone can respond to instructions given by the control module. There might be several cases where two or more components should work together for the success of the system.  An example includes delivering the package.  During delivery, adjusting the altitude, adjusting the rotor direction and reducing the speed will be required to ensure the careful release of the package.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p><strong>The feedback control phase:</strong></p>
				<p>The altitude, speed, and direction are three important control variables in the system. Each of them receives input from the sensors about the current state (speed, altitude and heading) of the drone.  This information is compared to the desired speed, altitude and direction provided by the control module. Based on this resulting comparison, necessary changes (feedback) are sent to the drone’s engine RPM and rotor tilt.</p>
				<p>Testing all these components together will ensure correct navigation to the destination. For safe and accurate navigation, a Traffic collision avoidance system is used to ensure the drone has the correct data for height, speed and direction while the drone is travelling.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p><strong>The control module phase:</strong></p>
				<p>This module plays a very important role in the whole system; it is essentially the heart of the system. Performing a thorough testing of this module with other modules would be a good idea. It collects the information from the transmitter/receiver and saves it to the internal memory. We should carefully check whether it can successfully gather information from the central system and from other components to communicate with the central system securely.</p>
				<p>We should also check whether the system can take appropriate actions in case of an emergency (low battery for example). The module’s control over other components should also be tested.  This includes using the GPS location to provide waypoint formation, communicating with the central monitoring system to receive updated routing if current location exceeds defined deviation parameters, sending a release message to the package carrying module, and sending a landing message using the transmitter.</p>
			</div>

		<!-- Integration Tests -->
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Integration Tests</h2>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>As we have planned to test the ‘Delivery Drone’ in four phases/builds, we will define the test cases for each of these builds. We will also define the integration testing strategies for each build, within each phase, as development progresses. Integration testing is done to test the integrated modules/components to verify that they work as expected.  In other words, the modules, which are working fine individually, are tested to see if there are no issues upon integration. We want to make sure all four builds work when their functionality combines with each other. For our application, all four modules are tightly coupled with each other. We can apply the integration testing technique concepts for testing end-to-end functionality. Normally, integration testing is done after “unit testing”. Once all the individual units are created and tested, we will start combining those “unit tested” modules and start performing the integration testing. First, we will test all four builds / individual modules in isolation. Once the modules are tested, they will be integrated one by one, until all the modules are integrated. Combinational behavior will then be checked, and the requirements will be validated for correct implementation. Once we complete our integration testing, we will perform validation testing to make sure all the functionality is achieved as mentioned in the requirements.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>Here we should understand that integration testing will not happen at the end of the development cycle, rather it will be conducted simultaneously with the development. Our expectation is that all the modules will not be available to test.  This presents a challenge, as we will need to test something which does not exist. In our application, the structure of data/intent changes when it travels from one module to another. Some values are appended, removed, or enhanced, which can cause issues in the later modules. Our integration testing will commence once the modules to be tested are available. “Stubs and drivers” will be used for the modules that have not been implemented yet. All our modules will be developed in sequence. Our goal is to detect the errors related to the interface between the four modules.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>There might be different paths and permutations which can be applied to test the integrated system. The big-bang approach integrates all the modules in one go i.e., the modules are not integrated one by one in this approach. It verifies if the system works as expected once integrated. If any issue is detected in the completely integrated module, then it becomes difficult to find out which module has caused the issue later in development/testing. The big-bang approach is a time-consuming process, as it can take time to find a defect in a module once it is detected.  Fixing the defect would be costly, as it has been detected at a later stage. This approach is good for small systems. For this reason, we will not apply the big bang approach for our project initially.  The four modules add to the overall complexity of the project. Each module will be tested in sequence. Once each module is developed, we will utilize the big-bang approach and test all integration test cases again.  After which, we will perform our end-to-end validation testing.</p>
