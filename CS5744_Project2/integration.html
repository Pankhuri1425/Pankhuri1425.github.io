			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>As we have planned to test the ‘Delivery Drone’ in four phases/builds, we will define the test cases for each of these builds. We will also define the integration testing strategies for each build, within each phase, as development progresses. Integration testing is done to test the integrated modules/components to verify that they work as expected.  In other words, the modules, which are working fine individually, are tested to see if there are no issues upon integration. We want to make sure all four builds work when their functionality combines with each other. For our application, all four modules are tightly coupled with each other. We can apply the integration testing technique concepts for testing end-to-end functionality. Normally, integration testing is done after “unit testing”. Once all the individual units are created and tested, we will start combining those “unit tested” modules and start performing the integration testing. First, we will test all four builds / individual modules in isolation. Once the modules are tested, they will be integrated one by one, until all the modules are integrated. Combinational behavior will then be checked, and the requirements will be validated for correct implementation. Once we complete our integration testing, we will perform validation testing to make sure all the functionality is achieved as mentioned in the requirements.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>Here we should understand that integration testing will not happen at the end of the development cycle, rather it will be conducted simultaneously with the development. Our expectation is that all the modules will not be available to test.  This presents a challenge, as we will need to test something which does not exist. In our application, the structure of data/intent changes when it travels from one module to another. Some values are appended, removed, or enhanced, which can cause issues in the later modules. Our integration testing will commence once the modules to be tested are available. “Stubs and drivers” will be used for the modules that have not been implemented yet. All our modules will be developed in sequence. Our goal is to detect the errors related to the interface between the four modules.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col py-2">
				<p>There might be different paths and permutations which can be applied to test the integrated system. The big-bang approach integrates all the modules in one go i.e., the modules are not integrated one by one in this approach. It verifies if the system works as expected once integrated. If any issue is detected in the completely integrated module, then it becomes difficult to find out which module has caused the issue later in development/testing. The big-bang approach is a time-consuming process, as it can take time to find a defect in a module once it is detected.  Fixing the defect would be costly, as it has been detected at a later stage. This approach is good for small systems. For this reason, we will not apply the big bang approach for our project initially.  The four modules add to the overall complexity of the project. Each module will be tested in sequence. Once each module is developed, we will utilize the big-bang approach and test all integration test cases again.  After which, we will perform our end-to-end validation testing.</p>
